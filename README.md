In our ever-connected world, mobile applications have become an integral part of our daily lives, providing us with convenient solutions for various tasks and activities. One of the most powerful and widely used features in mobile applications is mapping and location-based services. The ability to view and interact with maps has evolved significantly with the integration of Google Maps API, offering developers a robust platform to create innovative and interactive mapping applications. 

The fascinating realm of designing and developing mobile applications that leverage the Google Maps API to enhance user experiences by adding valuable information to map info windows. Info windows, those small pop-up boxes that appear when you tap on a location marker, can serve as a key conduit for presenting information about places, businesses, events, or any other geospatial data relevant to users. The importance of integrating information into maps cannot be overstated. Such applications go beyond simple navigation; they empower users with relevant, contextual information, making their decision-making process more informed and efficient. This delves into the intricacies of creating such mobile applications, covering the design principles, development methodologies, and the utilization of Google Maps API to add, update, and display information in info windows.

Explored the key components required for this endeavor, including user interface design, data management, and the utilization of various features offered by the Google Maps API, such as markers, overlays, and custom info windows. Furthermore, discussed the challenges and best practices associated with this undertaking, including ensuring data accuracy, optimizing performance, and providing a seamless and intuitive user experience. The development of such applications requires a multidisciplinary approach, combining elements of user experience (UX) design, data handling, and software development.

The design and development of mobile applications that add information to map info windows using the Google Maps API is a compelling and evolving field that has the potential to revolutionize how users interact with maps and location-based services. Aims to provide insights, guidance, and inspiration for developers and enthusiasts looking to create immersive and informative mapping applications that cater to the modern user's needs and preferences.

## Software Requirements
### Android Studio
Install latest version of Android Studio on the System. Android Studio helps you debug and improve the performance of your code, including inline debugging and performance analysis tools that also includes designing tool.
### Google Maps API
Used Google Maps API to authenticate Google Maps service for Android. It is a powerful set of tools and services provided by Google that enables developers to integrate interactive maps and location-based features into their web and mobile applications.
### Required Dependencies
●	App Compat: Ensures that apps can use modern Android features and design elements while still maintaining compatibility with older versions of the Android operating system.

●	Constraint Layout: Designed to simplify the process of creating complex layouts by using a flat view hierarchy and leveraging constraints to position and align views relative to each other. It allows to define the position and size of UI elements based on constraints to other views, parent layout boundaries, or guidelines.

●	GMS Play Service Maps: It is part of the Google Play Services library and allows developers to integrate Google Maps functionality into their Android applications.

●	JUnit: Provides a platform to write and execute unit tests, which are small, automated tests designed to verify the correctness of individual units or components of a software application.

●	Espresso: Designed to make it easier for developers to write efficient and reliable UI tests for their Android applications. Espresso provides a simple and concise API for interacting with and asserting the behavior of user interfaces.
